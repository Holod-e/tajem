# Starting_template
Starting template is a front-end HTML5 template. Featuring the latest technologies and impeccable code this download is the ideal starting point for any web project.

##Gulp - Start Guide
<p>Need to ensure you have everything on your machine (Node.js, npm, bower)</p>
<p>In root of template, use commands:</p>
<ul>
	<li>npm i</li>
	<li>bower i</li>
	<li>gulp (Run project)</li>
	<li>gulp build (Build project)</li>
</ul>

##SASS Partials
<p>The partials directory is where most of the CSS is constructed. Plan ahead and think how to structure these.</p>
<ul>
	<li>_buttons.scss - Button styles</li>
	<li>_variables.scss - Colours, Typography</li>
	<li>_media.scss - Media queries</li>
</ul>

##Structuring your projects
<p>This is a developer preference. There is no official way. Do you want all your pages in partials? Would you rather just add main components and still use style.scss for the bulk of the CSS? Do what's best for you and your project.</p>
